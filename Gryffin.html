      Gryffindor is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
      Wizardry and was founded by Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the
      Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued,
      such as courage, chivalry, and determination, to be sorted into his
      house. The emblematic animal is a lion, and its colours are scarlet and
      gold. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless
      Nick" is the House ghost. Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element
      of fire, and it is for this reason that the colours scarlet and gold were
      chosen to represent the house. The colour of fire corresponds to that
      of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold
      representing the coat.
