    <p class="cunning">
      The founder highly valued and favoured Pure-blood students and the Sorting
      Hat admitted that it can be a factor when being sorted.Students of
      any blood status can be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-Born
      student from that house is considered to be quite rare.The emblematic
      animal of the house is a snake and the house's colours are green and
      silver. There were two notable heads of the house; Horace Slughorn took
      the role twice (first leaving in 1981 and then taking the role again from
      1997 until leaving before 2016),and Severus Snape.The patron
      ghost of the house is the Bloody Baron.Slytherin corresponds roughly
      with the element of water due to serpents being commonly associated with
      the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as well as serpents being
      physically fluid and flexible animals.Similarly, in Celtic mythology,
      water is seen as a portal to another world, leading some to speculate that
      the element was chosen to symbolise many Slytherins' hope for a pure-blood
      only community. The colours also correspond with waters around lakes and
      lochs often being green, and silver being often associated with grey
      rainwater.
