      Hufflepuff was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
      Wizardry.Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff.
      Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard
      work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a
      particular aptitude in its members.The emblematic animal was a
      badger,yellow and black were its house colours.The Head of
      Hufflepuff was Pomona Sprout,and the Fat Friar was the House's patron
      ghost.Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to the element of earth,and
      it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen: yellow
      represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil.The Hufflepuff
      point hourglass contains yellow diamonds.Students sorted into
      Hufflepuff often demonstrate exceptional abilities in Herbology, owing to
      their correspondence to earth.
