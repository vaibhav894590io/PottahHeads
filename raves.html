      Ravenclaw is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
      Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw. Members
      of this house are characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. The
      emblematic animal symbol is an eagle, and blue and bronze are its
      colours. The Head of Ravenclaw is Filius Flitwick, and the house
      ghost is the Grey Lady,real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of
      Rowena.Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of air,and
      it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen; blue and bronze
      represent the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do
      with air.The Ravenclaw points hourglass contains blue sapphires.
